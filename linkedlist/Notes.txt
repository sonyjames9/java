Notes
-------------
- Draw addition and deletion of nodes in each type and you can implement

** Singly LinkedList

Arrays is not a continous memory allocation

Single Linked List None - head - nodes - tail - None
Node points to another Node

For loop to traverse to the end

Try to imagine your code representation. 
Here it's the linkedList, imagine the linkedlist, draw it draw the nodes and arrows,
. It will give an idea.

Add head and tails in your whiteboard.

Question why single linkedlist only moves ahead and not backwards?

- Then implement it
Since single linkedlist has value and reference, the pointer 
- head should always point to first node and tail to always last node



** Doubly LinkedList

- LinkedList with pointers pointing to next and previous node.
- The first node's previous pointer will point to null
- The last node's next pointer will point to null
-
